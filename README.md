# impavi
I built a Python module with useful functions for Image Processing and Artificial Vision. The impavi module is named using the initials (IM)age (P)rocessing and (A)rtificial (VI)sion. 
 
You'll find some simple functions such as impavi.luminance(rgb) and impavi.equalize(im,plot=False)
There are more complex algorithms like Floyd-Steinbeirg (FS) algorithm for error compensation and the implementation of a Kirsch Compass filter. 

If the module is useful to you feel free to use it citing "Ignacio Cordova Pou; https://github.com/ignaciocordova"
